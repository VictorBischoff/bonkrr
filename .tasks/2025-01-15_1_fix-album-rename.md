# Task Description
Fix the album folder renaming error in the MediaProcessor class. Currently, when trying to rename an album folder from its temporary name to the final name, it fails if the target directory already exists and is not empty.

# Project Overview
Bunkrr is a media downloader application that allows users to download media files from Bunkr.site. The application handles album downloads, processes media files, and organizes them into folders.

# Task Analysis
- The issue occurs in the `process_album` method of the `MediaProcessor` class
- Current behavior:
  - Creates a temporary folder with album ID
  - Attempts to rename it to the final name using the album title
  - Fails if the target directory exists and is not empty
- Root cause:
  - Using `Path.rename()` which fails on non-empty target directories
  - No handling for existing target directories
- Implementation goals:
  - Handle existing target directories gracefully
  - Preserve existing content
  - Ensure unique folder names
  - Maintain data integrity
