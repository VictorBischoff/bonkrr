# Task Description
Optimize URL validation in the Bunkrr application by:
1. Pre-compiling regular expressions used in URL validation for faster matching
2. Leveraging aiohttp utilities for URL parsing and validation
3. Improving domain validation efficiency
4. Optimizing regex patterns for better performance

# Project Overview
Bunkrr is a high-performance media downloader application designed to efficiently download media files from Bunkr.site. The application features a modern terminal user interface, robust error handling, and optimized concurrent downloads.

# Task Analysis
- Purpose: Improve URL validation performance and reliability
- Issues identified:
  1. Regex pattern is compiled on each URLValidator instance creation
  2. Basic URL parsing uses urllib.parse instead of aiohttp utilities
  3. Domain validation uses multiple string operations
  4. Complex regex pattern could be optimized and split for better maintainability
  5. No caching of validation results for repeated URLs

- Implementation goals:
  1. Move regex compilation to class level
  2. Utilize aiohttp's URL parsing utilities
  3. Optimize domain validation with set operations
  4. Split regex pattern into smaller, focused patterns
  5. Add caching for validation results

# Final Review
1. URL Validation Optimizations:
   - Pre-compiled regex patterns at class level
   - Split complex patterns into focused ones
   - Added length constraints for IDs (3-30 chars)
   - Improved domain and subdomain validation
   - Added URL decoding for better ID validation

2. Performance Improvements:
   - Added LRU caching for validation results
   - Optimized domain validation with set operations
   - Reduced string operations in validation
   - Improved error handling and reporting

3. Code Quality:
   - Added comprehensive test suite
   - Improved code organization
   - Enhanced error messages
   - Better type hints and documentation
   - Followed Python best practices

4. Testing Coverage:
   - Valid URL scenarios
   - Invalid URL scenarios
   - URL normalization
   - Caching behavior
   - Input handling
   - Edge cases

All objectives have been successfully completed, resulting in a more efficient and robust URL validation system.
