# Task: Optimize Async Performance

## Description
Implement performance optimizations for the Bunkrr downloader focusing on async operations, connection management, and I/O efficiency.

## Project Overview
The Bunkrr downloader requires optimization in several key areas to improve performance and reliability.

## Task Analysis
1. Rate Limiter Optimization:
   - Current custom RateLimiter class needs improvement
   - Implement more efficient sliding window algorithm
   - Add proper error handling and retry logic

2. HTML Parser Optimization:
   - Switch to lxml parser for better performance
   - Optimize parsing scope with strainers
   - Add caching for parsed results

3. File I/O Optimization:
   - Use aiofiles for non-blocking I/O
   - Implement buffered writes
   - Add proper error handling

4. Connection Management:
   - Optimize connection pool settings
   - Implement proper timeout handling
   - Add connection monitoring

## Implementation Goals
1. Improve rate limiting efficiency
2. Reduce HTML parsing overhead
3. Optimize file I/O operations
4. Enhance connection management
